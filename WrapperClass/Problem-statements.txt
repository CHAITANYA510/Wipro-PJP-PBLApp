-------------------Wrapper classes----------------------

[Wrapper class]
1.
 Write a java program that generates the minimum and maximum value
for each of the Numeric Wrapper classes (Byte, Short, nteger,
Long, Float, Double)
Sample Output:
Integer range:
min: -2147483648
max: 2147483647
Double range:
min: 4.9E-324
max: 1.7976931348623157E308
Long range:
min: -9223372036854775808
max: 9223372036854775807
Short range:
min: -32768
max: 32767
Byte range:
min: -128
max: 127
Float range:
min: 1.4E-45
max: 3.4028235E38

2
 Write a program to receive an integer number as a command line
argument, and print the binary, octal and hexadecimal equivalent
of the given number.
Sample Output:
java Test 20
Given Number :20
Binary equivalent :10100
Octal equivalent :24
Hexadecimal equivalent :14

3
 Write a Java program that reads an integer number (between 1 and
255) from the user and prints the binary representation of the
number. The answer should be printed as a String.
Note: The output displayed should contain 8 digits and should be
padded with leading 0s(zeros), in case the returned String
contains less than 8 characters.
For example, if the user enters the value 16, then the output
should be
 00010000
and if the user enters the value 100, the output should be
 01100100
You are expected to use Integer class conversion method/s
described in the PDF file.
Use Scanner class to accept user inputs.
(Hint : You may use String.format() method for the expected
output)

[Cloning]
4
 Create an employee class with properties of your choice. Create
an object of this class and also create a clone of the same. After
making the clone, change the properties of the original employee
object and print the properties of both the original and clone
object and note down your observation.
